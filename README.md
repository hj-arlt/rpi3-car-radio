CAR Radio project

Build a car radio, based on raspberry 3x and a interface board.
The hardware includes a complete vehicle-friendly application.
The construction fits into a 2" car radio device tray.

The application software based on:
- Raspbian stretch Desktop -> https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
- kernel rpi-4.9.x -> https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/tree/rpi-4.9.y
- QT5.11.1.                -> https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.11/index.html

since Qt5.11 and higher, we can support OSM maps for navigation
